# Changelog

## [v0.1.4-alpha] - 2025-06-11

### The scratch_pad Tool: Persistent AI Workspace

After a bunch of refinements the scratch_pad tool has matured into a
very interesting tool - a freeform **JSON data structure** shared
across all chat sessions in chat client.

#### What It Does

- **Persistent memory**: Data survives across conversations
- **Flexible storage**: Any JSON data (objects, arrays, strings, numbers)
- **Path operations**: Use `set_path`/`get_path`/`delete_path` for precise data manipulation
- **AI workspace**: Serves as both thinking tool and progress tracker

#### Structured Planning

For complex features, use the new `plan-and-execute` prompt which leverages scratch_pad to:
- Research problems thoroughly
- Break down tasks into manageable subtasks  
- Track progress with structured todo lists
- Maintain context throughout development

### Added
- **Ripgrep (rg) support** in grep tool with intelligent fallback hierarchy (rg > grep > Java)
- **Smart path operations** in scratch_pad tool for automatic string-to-number conversion and data structure initialization

### Changed
- **Tool rename**: `fs_grep` â†’ `grep` for better consistency
- Enhanced scratch_pad with smart path munging for vector indices
- Improved error handling for streaming operations with null parameters

### Fixed
- Streaming errors when receiving null parameters in MCP operations
- Schema validation errors in tool operations

### Internal
- General code linting and cleanup across multiple files
- Improved documentation and README content

## [v0.1.3-alpha] - 2025-06-09

### Added
- **Configurable file timestamp tracking** via `:write-file-guard` option (`:full-read`, `:partial-read`, or `false`)
- File existence validation in `unified_read_file` tool
- FAQ.md documenting file timestamp tracking behavior
- Docker support (`:dkr-nrepl` alias)
- `plan-and-execute` prompt for structured planning workflows
- Test coverage for new features

### Changed
- Enhanced scratch_pad prompt to encourage planning usage
- Clojure files always read as text format
- nREPL aliases now bind to 0.0.0.0 for network access
- Cleaned up unused prompt definitions

### Documentation
- FAQ with table of contents explaining timestamp tracking
- Updated system prompts and README with Wiki link
