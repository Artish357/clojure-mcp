# workflow ideas

Important to be able to stop and edit the repl interactions?

## Claude Desktop 

It would be nice for it to stop after N REPL evaluations and present an Artifact.

It would be nice to changes modes of develeopment.

> I think utlimately a rich workflow like Claude while being able to EDIT REPL suggestions would be great.

## RebelReadline

This could be the more immediately availble sane workflow.

:repl/ai-pmpt
actually better to have prompts auto complete

:repl/ai-ask

:repl/ai-step

:repl/ai-iter n

:rpel/ai-alt 
:repl/ai-set-alt-choices - set's number of choices so that you have selections 
These can also be bound to ctrl keys.


all the other stuff model setting git checkins, filesystem tools, although it can be done through the repl.
